# :exclamation: IMPORTANT :exclamation:

The "Projects" and "Example_Project" directories are only within the MoFA package to provide example for how to structure an external (i.e., local) project directory. Please do not create individual projects within these directories if you plan on pushing a branch of the MoFA package to the GitHub repository.



# Notes:

- Sample bash scripts for making and executing the solvers can be found in ./Example_Project/scripts/
